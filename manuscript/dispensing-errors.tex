\begin{abstract}

All data has error, but understanding the magnitude, type, and primary origin of the errors in experimental assay data is not often obvious.
Here, we describe a simple set of assay modeling techniques that allow sources of error and bias to be simulated and propagated into assay results.
We demonstrate how deceptively simple operations---such as the creation of a dilution series with a robotic liquid handler---can significantly amplify imprecision and even contribute substantially to bias.
To illustrate these techniques, we review an infamous example of how choice of dispensing technology can greatly impact assay measurements, and show how the primary contributions to discrepancies between assay results can be easily understood.
These simple modeling techniques---illustrated with an accompanying IPython notebook---can allow modelers to understand the expected error and bias in the experimental datasets, and even help experimentalists in the design stage to more effectively target accuracy and imprecision goals.

\section{Introduction}
\label{section:introduction}

Measuring the activity and potency of ligands---whether in biophysical or cell-based assays---is a critical tool in the understanding of biological processes.
However, understanding assay data for the purpose of optimizing small molecules for use as chemical probes or potential therapeutics is complicated by the fact that all assay data are contaminated with error from numerous sources.

Often, the dominant contributions to assay error are simply not known---unsurprising, given the number and variety of potential contributing factors.
Even for what might be considered a straightforward assay involving fluorescent measurements of a ligand binding to a protein target, this might include (but is by no means limited to): compound impurities and degradation~\cite{kozikowski_effect_2003,kozikowski_effect_2003-1,cheng_studies_2003,waybright_overcoming_2009}, imprecise compound dispensing, unmonitored water absorption by DMSO stocks, the effect of DMSO on protein stability~\cite{tjernberg_dmso-related_2005}, intrinsic compound fluorescence~\cite{simeonov_fluorescence_2008,baell_new_2010}, compound insolubility~\cite{di_biological_2006} or aggregation~\cite{mcgovern_common_2002,mcgovern_kinase_2003,feng_high-throughput_2005,feng_synergy_2006,baell_new_2010}, variability in protein concentration or quality, pipetting errors, and inherent noise in any fluorescence measurement---not to mention stray lab coat fibers as fluorescent contaminants~\cite{busch_does_2015}. 
In an ideal world, control experiments would be performed to measure the magnitude of these effects, and data quality tests would either reject flawed data or ensure that all contributions to error have been carefully accounted for in producing an assessment of error and confidence for each assayed value.

%Often computational chemists are faced with comparing their models to experimental assay data for which there is no clear idea of the magnitude of the error. Sometimes no error is provided. Sometimes only a ballpark estimate is given. It would be useful to be able to get an estimate of how confident one should be in the data they are looking at. Other times, one might want to ensure ahead of time that an assay will produce useful data. For example if the error is larger than the dynamic range of the expected measurements, the assay will not be very useful.

Unfortunately, by the time the data reach the hands of a modeler (or other data consumer), the opportunity to perform these careful control experiments has passed.
In the worst case, the communicated assay data may not contain any estimate of error at all. Even when error has been estimated, it is often not based on a holistic picture of specific information known about the assay.
One approach that has been useful is aggregating many datasets to give a crude estimate of the general reliability of a similar set of assays~\cite{kramer_experimental_2012,kalliokoski_comparability_2013}. 
However, going the other way, narrowing instead of broadening one's focus: the knowledge of how a particular assay was conducted can inform the construction of an assay-specific model incorporating some of the dominant contributions to error in a manner that can be highly informative.

%In many papers and reports errors or not provided or are inadequately explained. Our understanding of the reliability of experimental measurements of ligand binding affinity would be greatly increased if it was common practice to calculate expected experimental errors resulting from the major known sources.


In this paper, we review some common sources of error in experimental assays, and describe some simple modeling tools for simulating a model of an assay that incorporates these important (often dominant) sources of error. 
This approach, while simple, provides a powerful tool to understand how assay error depends on  known parameters. 
For example, with this approach, we can estimate the expected data error as a function of compound affinity.
Not only modelers could benefit from this approach---these tools can be also used to help optimize assay formats before an experiment is performed, help troubleshoot problematic assays after the fact, or ensure that all major sources of error accounted for by checking that variations among controls match expectations.

We illustrate these concepts by considering a now-infamous example from the literature: a report by Ekins et al.~\cite{ekins_dispensing_2013} on how the choice of dispensing technology impacts the apparent biological activity of the same set of compounds under otherwise identical conditions.
The datasets employed in the analyses [CITE] used either a standard liquid handler with fixed (washable) tips or an acoustic droplet dispensing device to prepare the assay, resulting in highly divergent assay results (Figure~\ref{fig:overview}).
While the frustration for modelers was particularly great, since QSAR models derived from these otherwise identical assays produce surprisingly divergent predictions, numerous practitioners from all corners of drug discovery expressed their frustration in ensuing blog posts and commentaries~\cite{in-the-pipeline-comments}.
Hosts of potential reasons were speculated~\cite{in-the-pipeline-comments}, including [LIST HERE].

We make use of this real-world example to illustrate some of the basic concepts behind modeling the most common sources of error in assays.
For simplicity, we ask whether the most basic contributions to assay error---imprecision and bias in material transfer operations and imprecision in measurement---might account for some component of the discrepancy between assay techniques.
We make use of basic information---the assay protocol as described (with some additional inferences based on basic concepts such as compound solubility limits) and manufacturer specifications for imprecision and bias---to construct a model of each dispensing process to determine the overall inaccuracy and imprecision of the assay as a function of true compound affinity, and identify the steps that contribute the most to these assay data errors.
To better illustrate these techniques, we also provide an annotated IPython notebook that includes all of the computations described here in detail.
Readers are encouraged to download these notebooks and play with them to see how different assay configurations affect assay error.

\section{Experimental error}

Overall experimental error can be broken into two components: The \emph{imprecision} (or variance), which characterizes the random component of the error that causes different replicates of the same assay to give slightly different results, and the \emph{inaccuracy} (or bias), which is the deviation of the average over many replicates from the true value of the quantity being measured.

There are a variety of sources of experimental error. For imprecision, random variation in the quantity delivered by a pipette, random errors in the reported mass of a dry compound, or random errors in the measured fluorescence of a well will all contribute.  The important thing is that the mean of these errors over many repetitions is zero.  If the mean is \emph{not} zero, this is an example of inaccuracy, or bias---where a calibration error leads to a systematic deviation in the volume delivered by a pipette, the mass measured by a balance, or the average fluorescence measured by a plate reader.

\section*{Modeling experimental error}

Modeling experimental error is as simple as adding known values for imprecision and inaccuracy into a known assay. 

\subsection*{Error propagation}

\subsection*{Simple liquid handling: Mixing solutions}

When an assay involves mixing two compounds together, as with most assays, you also have to consider mixing efficiency. 
For example if an assay involves mixing compound stock with a protein solution, usually a small volume into a much larger volume, uneven mixing can cause wide variation in the results. 
\begin{itemize}
  \item Several examples of this have been seen where, bla, bla, bla [ref,ref,ref]. 
  \item Rules for propagation of error. 
  \item Mention that the difficulties in mixing are not even considered in our simple model (we just assume good mixing).
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Making a dilution series}

Dilution series are often used to characterize the activity and potency of ligands. In dilution series, however, experimental errors are compounded, because the errors at an initial step of the dilution series will carry through to the next step. 
For example a 10\% error when transferring 50 $\mu$L from an initial stock to 50 $\mu$L of buffer to make a 1:2 dilution, will then end up being a 28\% total error once the 8th part of the dilution series is made. 
\begin{itemize}
  \item Explain bias and CV. 
  \item CV is amplified with each dilution
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Pipette-based liquid handling.}

To construct a model of a dilution series we start with our initial well at concentration, $C0$, and then transfer volume, $Vtransfer$, to create $ndilutions$ as illustrated in (Figure~\ref{fig:dilution}). We can add imprecision and bias to this by using manufacturer-provided values for the Tecan Genesis: the imprecision is stated as 3\% and the inaccuracy as 3-5\% for the volumes in question. Then, running many replicates of this model we can get a good estimate for the errors in volumes and concentrations, from which pIC50 can then be directly calculated (Figure~\ref{fig:acoustic-vs-tips}).  

\begin{figure*}[tb]
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{../figures/dilution.pdf}

  \caption{{\bf A programmatic tip-based dilution series.}
  In this dilution series we start with our initial well at concentration, $C0$, with initial volume, $Vinitial$. A volume, $Vtransfer$, is then transferred into a volume, $Vbuffer$, of buffer. In this case $Vtransfer$ and $Vbuffer$ are equal, so the concentration of the second well will be $C0/2$. This transfer is then repeated for all subsequent wells, the number of which is defined by $ndilutions$. From the last well the volume $Vtransfer$ is removed, so that all wells have the same final volume of $Vtransfer=Vbuffer$.
  }
  \label{fig:dilution}
\end{figure*}

\subsubsection*{Direct dispensing technologies.}

For acoustic dispensing, however, this accumulated error in a dilution series is not a factor, since each step of the dilution is pipetted separately and directly, with good precision and accuracy down to very low volumes, in the case of the LabCyte Echo (Figure~\ref{acoustic-vs-tips}). Despite the promises of the LabCyte Echo, we can see that it's CV and biases are mostly similar to that of the Tecan Genesis, even taking into account compounded error in the dilution series.

\begin{figure*}[tb]
    \includegraphics[trim={0 9cm 0 9cm},clip,width=0.5\textwidth]{../figures/direct_dispense.pdf}

  \caption{{\bf A programmatic direct dispense-based dilution series.}
  With direct dispense, each well is defined individually, not depending on the other, and $C0$ defines the concentration of the ligand stock. The $mix\_volume$ defines the final volume of the enzyme and ligand mix. The $dispense\_volume$ is the amount of the compound stock in DMSO that is dispensed into the mix\_volume, and is what determines the final concentration of the ligand in the direct dispense assay setup. To maintain a constant DMSO concentration throughout the assay, in this case 120 nL, a volume, defined by $backfill\_volume$, of pure DMSO is dispensed into the assay.
  }
  \label{ref:direct_dispense}
\end{figure*}

\subsubsection*{Fixed pipette tips and the dilution effect.}

Another aspect of dispensing with multichannel liquid-handler, is the possibility of the dilution effect when using liquid-based fixed-tip pipetting, such as on the Tecan Genesis. 
This dilution effect was previously characterized in blank et al (BMS paper(S?)), and we can use these values to improve our model for the error in the multichannel liquid-handler. 
We can easily see that including this error, significantly shifts the bias we see for tip-based dispensing (Figure~\ref{acoustic-vs-tips}).

{\color{red}[JDC: Do we want to describe this here, or instead discuss it within \emph{Pipette-based liquid handling} above (breaking this into disposable and fixed tips), or tackle it later after we note that imprecision is insufficient to explain the Ekins discrepancy?]}

\begin{figure*}[tb]
    \includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{../figures/tips_v_acoustic.pdf}

  \caption{{\bf Comparing modeled errors in pIC50 values from tip-based vs acoustic dispensing.}
  Using our model we can look at the variance in activity measurements as a function of inhibitor concentration $[I]$ (top), which then directly translates into a distribution of measured $pIC50$ values (middle), from which we can find out the bias and variance, or CV, as a function of pKi seen in these assays (bottom). While using acoustic dispensing methods the CV creeps up as a function of pKi, when a known dilution effect is added to the tip-based dispensing, a large bias is easy to spot.
  }
  \label{fig:acoustic-vs-tips}
\end{figure*}

\subsection*{Modeling plate reader measurement}

When measuring readouts of fluorescence assays, it is important to take intrinsic error in plate reader measurement into account. All observations have error. 
Luckily most plate readers already have these stats on hand in their manuals. 
For example the {\bf XXX} used in this example has a fluorescence detection threshold of {\bf XXX} and an error of {\bf XXX}.

\subsection*{Modeling an enzymatic reaction}

Creating a simple model of a competition assay can be done using standard formulas, here assuming we have data for $V_\mathrm{max}$. 
Similar models can be created for different assay readouts.

\subsection*{Imprecision is insufficient to explain the Ekins discrepancy}

Plotting the inaccuracies and imprecisions and how they differ for tip-based dispensing vs. direct dispensing is extremely useful, and allows us to understand the errors in our assay results a bit better. 
It is easy to see that simple difference in these values, even when including the compounded error of the dilution series, does not give us much insight into the striking differences seen in Ekins et al between tip-based and direct dispensing.

However, if we incorporate the final component of error in tip-based dispensing, the dilution effect, we can see that correcting for this bias in plotting IC50 shifts tip-based values more toward direct-dispensing derived values (Figure~\ref{IC50_bias}).

\begin{figure*}[tb]
    \includegraphics[trim={0 4cm 0 4cm},clip,width=0.5\textwidth]{../figures/compare-pIC50-bias_corrected.pdf}

  \caption{{\bf Adding bias shifts pIC50 values closer to equivalence.}
  Here we see (in red) the original experimental data points with errors bars representing the uncertainty calculated from our models. Adding in the bias from our models (in green) shifts the experimental pIC50 values closer to if tip-based assay and acoustic-based assay measurements resulted in the same final measurement. While this does not entirely explain the discrepancies between the two sets of data, it provides an initial insight, and shows the power of building simple error models to improve our understanding of experimental data sets.

% DISCUSSION
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Discussion}

Serial dilutions are commonly used in the process of determining biologically and clinically relevant values such as inhibition concentrations (IC$_{ 50}$)  and dissociation constants (K$_{d}$). 
While high-throughput automation methods can improve the reproducibility of these measurements over manual pipetting, even robotic liquid handlers are victim to systematic error. 
Here, we have demonstrated how a simple model {\color{red} [which, in addition to blank blank, other resources for modeling error]} that allowed us to estimate the imprecision and inaccuracy of the measured IC$_{50}$ values, as well as identify the difficulty in creating an accurate dilution series as the major contribution to discrepancies in measurements between fixed pipette tip and direct dispensing technologies. 
We hope this will be a useful tool for experimental and computational chemists to understand common sources of error within assays that use dilution series and how to model and correct for them.

This however, is just one example of what can generally be done if this model is pursued for other times of experiments relevant to computational modelers.
Ideally, experimentalists should verify ahead of time via this or a similar approach that their assay appropriately discriminates among the properties of the molecules in question given the expected range of IC$_{ 50}$s or K$_{d}$s to be probed, combined with the errors already known to be intrinsic to the experiment. 
This kind of modeling will allow for assays to even be fine tuned to make sure the data is appropriate to the question at hand. 
For example, in our own laboratory, it has informed the decision to use only direct dispensing technologies for a our fluorescent ligand-binding assays.

Not only is this sort of modeling approach useful for design ahead of time and analysis after the fact of experiments, but it can be extremely useful in determining the right tests and controls to use to be sure errors and biases are properly taken into account in general. If one is not certain about the primary sources of error in an experiment, one is arguably not certain about the results of the experiment in general. 
Understanding these errors, and being certain they are accounted for via clear benchmarks in experimental assays could help ensure the reproducibility of assays in the future, which is currently a topic of great interest. 
Especially with such a wide ranging set of assays that use dilution series, most notably toward the development of proteins and small molecules to study and treat disease, this is a very important category of experiments to understand how to make more clearly reproducible and interpretable.

While here we have illustrated the importance of modeling to the specific case of liquid handling with fixed tips in the context of measuring IC50 values for EPHB4 inhibitors, there are still large discrepancies that have not been explained, and large swaths of systems both biological and mechanical that are still open for further investigation. 
As experiments become more automated and analysis becomes more quantitative understanding these errors will be increasingly important both for the consumers (modelers) and producers (experimentalists) of these data.
