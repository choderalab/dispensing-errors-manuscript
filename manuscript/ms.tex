%  \caption{{\bf Diagrammatic representation of the various stages of the Ensembler pipeline and illustrative statistics for modeling all human tyrosine kinase catalytic domains.}
%  On the left, the various stages of the {\bf Ensembler} pipeline are shown.
%  On the right, the number of viable models surviving each stage of the pipeline is shown for modeling all 90 tyrosine kinases (\emph{All TKs}) and representative individual tyrosine kinases (\emph{SRC} and \emph{ABL}).
%  Typical timings on a computer cluster (containing Intel Xeon E5-2665 2.4GHz hyperthreaded processors and NVIDIA GTX-680 or GTX-Titan GPUs) is reported to illustrate resource requirements per model for modeling the entire set of tyrosine kinases.
%  Note that \emph{CPU-h} denotes the number of hours consumed by the equivalent of a single CPU hyperthread and \emph{GPU-h} on a single GPU---parallel execution via MPI reduces wall clock time nearly linearly.
