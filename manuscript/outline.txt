OUTLINE

Introduction

Experimental assays are contaminated with error; many contributions to this error.
compound impurities not exactly known
imprecise quantities of compound are dispensed
compound DMSO stocks may absorb water or degrade
liquid handlers don’t pipette exact amount
protein concentrations inexact
measurements are inexact

Often, computational chemist is faced with assay data without a clear idea of magnitude of error
sometimes no error is provided
sometimes only one ballpark estimate of error for whole assay is provided
would really like some way to estimate how confident she should be in data

Other times, we might want to ensure that assay will produce useful data
if error is larger than dynamic range of measurements we expect to make, assay will be useless
would be useful if we could model assay before actually carrying it out

In this paper, we review common sources of error in experimental assays, and describe some simple modeling tools for simulating a model of an assay that includes some important sources of error.
a powerful tool for modelers to understand how error depends on important parameters, like compound affinity
provide accompanying IPython notebook with example
this approach can also help optimize assay formats to ensure they provide maximally useful information
can help troubleshoot problematic assays or ensure all major sources of error accounted for by ensuring that variation among controls matches expectation

Introductory example: Ekins paper
to illustrate these principles, we tackle a now-infamous example of the same assay performed using different dispensing technologies leading to vastly different IC50s (ref figure)
discuss how this led to different QSAR models
discuss various hyptheses from In the Pipeline about origin of discrepancy and concern expressed by chemists
we will show how the discrepancies can be simply understood using a simple model of the assay

Experimental error

Types of error
imprecision (variance)
inaccuracy (bias)

Common sources of error in experimental assays

Modeling experimental error

Simple liquid handling: Mixing solutions
example of how mixing solutions leads to error
rules for propagation of error
modeling the dilution operation
figure: mixing two solutions

Complex liquid handling: Dilution series
surprisingly difficult to create a dilution series accurately
discussion of difficulties in mixing, which aren’t even considered in our simple model; we assume good mixing
modeling error in dilution series for a liquid handler: CVs are amplified with each dilution
modeling error using LabCyte Echo
modeling error with HP D300
figure: dilution series illustration; comparison of CVs for liquid handling without dilution, LabCyte Echo, HP D300

Modeling an enzymatic reaction
simple model of a competition assay and measuring Vmax
simple models can be created for other assay readouts

Modeling plate reader measurement
all observations have error

Simple imprecision insufficient to explain the Ekins discrepancy: Fixed tips and the dilution effect
figure: Ekins IC50 comparison with error bars; shifted to account for bias
BMS papers that quantify and explain dilution effects
figure: illustration of dilution effect; resulting bias vs IC50
correcting for dilution effect brings Echo and tips-based dispensing much closer into agreement

Discussion

Why model assays?
during assay design: will the assay meet my goals?
during assay optimization: plug in measured uncertainties, optimize assay format
assay validation: do we understand all of the primary sources of error?
assay QC: are we reproducibly meeting our target behavior with our controls?
after an assay has been performed: how can I estimate the magnitude of error?

Take-away messages:
it’s hard to make a good dilution series!
a large liquid handling CV can still result in a smaller overall assay CV
dilution effects can be important in liquid handling with fixed tips; can lead to large biases
direct dispensing techniques can be useful in reducing bias and error

Helpful resources:
pointers to our IPython notebooks

Hi John,

Some things that would be particularly useful after looking through the outline: 
 - This first section of results, I am a bit unclear what we plan to say and how it relates to the Ekins paper:
 "Simple liquid handling: Mixing solutions
 example of how mixing solutions leads to error
 rules for propagation of error
 modeling the dilution operation
 figure: mixing two solutions"
 - If you have good examples for 'other useful resources for modeling assays' that would be great to look at!
 - Also I'm a bit unclear on how we plan to incorporate the plate measurement error discussion. In the two patents it mentions using the Perkin Elmer EnVision plate reader for the EphB4 assay, do we want to incorporate the specs of this into our analysis somehow?
 
 Thanks!
 
 -Sonya
